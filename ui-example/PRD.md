## Design Direction

The interface should evoke a premium, professional creative tool - sleek like DaVinci Resolve but more approachable, with the energy of modern beat-making software. Dark theme creates focus while neon accents provide energy and visual hierarchy for important actions.

## Color Selection

Complementary (opposite colors) - Electric fuchsia against deep blacks creates maximum contrast and energy, perfect for a creative tool that needs to be both functional and inspiring.

- **Primary Color**: Electric Fuchsia `oklch(0.7 0.3 330)` - Commands attention for primary actions and active states
- **Secondary Colors**: Deep Charcoal `oklch(0.15 0 0)` for main backgrounds, Medium Gray `oklch(0.3 0 0)` for secondary surfaces
- **Accent Color**: Bright Pink `oklch(0.8 0.25 340)` - Highlighting active timeline elements and effect indicators
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (Deep Black `oklch(0.1 0 0)`): White text `oklch(0.95 0 0)` - Ratio 19:1 ✓
  - Card (Dark Charcoal `oklch(0.15 0 0)`): Light Gray text `oklch(0.9 0 0)` - Ratio 15.2:1 ✓  
  - Primary (Electric Fuchsia `oklch(0.7 0.3 330)`): Black text `oklch(0.1 0 0)` - Ratio 7:1 ✓
  - Accent (Bright Pink `oklch(0.8 0.25 340)`): Black text `oklch(0.1 0 0)` - Ratio 8:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should feel technical yet approachable - clean sans-serif that maintains readability in professional editing contexts while supporting the creative energy of the application.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (App Title): Inter Bold/24px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Panel Headers): Inter Semibold/18px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Section Labels): Inter Medium/14px/wide letter spacing
  - Body (UI Text): Inter Regular/14px/normal spacing
  - Small (Timeline Labels): Inter Regular/12px/normal spacing

## Animations

Subtle, purposeful animations that enhance workflow without distracting from creative focus - smooth transitions guide attention during state changes while maintaining professional feel.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Motion reinforces the beat-based nature of the application, with subtle pulses on beat markers and smooth timeline scrubbing
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Timeline scrubbing and effect previews deserve primary animation focus, followed by panel transitions and hover states
