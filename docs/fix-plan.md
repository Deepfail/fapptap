🔎 Current Behavior (Why it feels wrong)

UI (StaticUnifiedApp.tsx)

Selecting a video just appends it to selectedVideos (basically a playlist).

When you hit Generate Preview, it immediately:

Runs beat detection (main.py → run_beats).

Copies videos to a temp dir.

Generates a cutlist (build_cutlist.py) purely from beats/shots.

Calls FFmpeg render and spits out a preview MP4.

The only “timeline” you see is a read-only visualization of cutlist.json.
→ There’s no editing stage — no way to tweak cuts/effects before render.

Editor store (editorStore.tsx)

Defines a real timeline model: clips, in/out, trim, ripple, effects, undo/redo.

But nothing in StaticUnifiedApp.tsx uses this store.
It just reads the cutlist into state.timelineCuts (a static array), not into the EditorProvider.

Python backend (main.py, build_cutlist.py)

Generates deterministic events (src, in, out, effects) and renders them with FFmpeg.

No mechanism to re-ingest user edits from the timeline before rendering.

That’s why you can only generate → download, skipping “edit & effect” phase.

⚡ Why it’s different from Beatleap

Beatleap’s workflow:

Pick music → auto-generate timeline cuts synced to beats.

User can interactively edit timeline (reorder, trim, apply effects).

Only then export.

Your app skips step 2. It behaves like an auto-slideshow maker rather than an editor.

🛠 What’s Missing

Bridge cutlist.json into the EditorStore:

Instead of dumping into state.timelineCuts, map events → EditorState.timeline items.

That enables trimming, moving, adding effects.

UI hooks for editing:

Right now, you only visualize timeline cuts.
Need drag/drop, trim handles, and effect toggles tied to editorStore.

Modified render pipeline:

At export, don’t just re-run cutlist.py.

Serialize the edited EditorState.timeline into a JSON and pass that into the Python worker.

Update render_direct_filter_complex to respect user-defined effects (zoom, shake, etc.).

✅ Next Step (concrete fix plan)

Load cutlist into editor store:

import { useEditor } from "@/state/editorStore";
...
const editor = useEditor();
const timelineItems = cutlistData.events.map((event, i) => ({
id: `item-${i}`,
clipId: event.src,
start: event.in,
in: event.in,
out: event.out,
effects: event.effects || [],
}));
editor.updateTimelineItems(timelineItems);

→ This makes the auto-generated cuts editable.

Connect UI to editor state instead of state.timelineCuts.

Replace timelineCuts with editor.timeline.

Use editor.updateTimelineItemEffects when toggling effects.

Change export:

Before calling render, dump editor.timeline to cache/cutlist.json.

Then main.py → run_render will pick up the modified timeline.

👉 So right now your app is always skipping editing because the preview step is tightly wired to auto-cutlist → render. To make it “Beatleap Advanced PC Edition,” you need to inject the editor store between cutlist and render.

Yep — that error means the frontend is invoke-ing Tauri commands that don’t exist in your Rust side. Two quick ways to fix it:

Option A (fastest): stop invoke-ing and just read the files directly

You’re already using @tauri-apps/plugin-fs. Swap the invoke('read_cutlist')/invoke('read_beats_file') calls for plain file reads and try both likely paths.

Patch StaticUnifiedApp.tsx

Replace your current loadTimelineCuts and any beats-loader that calls invoke(...) with this:

// at top:
import { readTextFile } from "@tauri-apps/plugin-fs";
import { appDataDir, resourceDir } from "@tauri-apps/api/path";

// helper that tries several locations
async function readJsonFromCandidates(candidates: string[]): Promise<any | null> {
  for (const p of candidates) {
    try {
      const txt = await readTextFile(p);
      return JSON.parse(txt);
    } catch {
      // keep trying
    }
  }
  return null;
}

// CUTLIST
const loadTimelineCuts = useCallback(async () => {
  try {
    // try common locations we write to during generation
    // 1) render/ (proxy/final live here)  2) cache/  3) appDataDir under your app
    const appDir = (await appDataDir()).replace(/\\+/g, "/");

    const cutlist =
      (await readJsonFromCandidates([
        "render/cutlist.json",
        "cache/cutlist.json",
        `${appDir}/render/cutlist.json`,
        `${appDir}/cache/cutlist.json`,
      ])) || { events: [] };

    // bridge into EditorStore instead of local state
    const items =
      (cutlist.events || []).map((ev: any, i: number) => ({
        id: `item-${i}`,
        clipId: ev.src,
        start: ev.in ?? 0,
        in: ev.in ?? 0,
        out: ev.out ?? 0,
        effects: ev.effects ?? [],
      }));

    editor.updateTimelineItems(items);
    return items; // if caller wants it
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Failed to load cutlist into editor:", err);
    return [];
  }
}, [/* editor from useEditor */]);


And for beats (where you had invoke('read_beats_file')), add:

async function loadBeatsJson() {
  const appDir = (await appDataDir()).replace(/\\+/g, "/");
  const beats =
    (await readJsonFromCandidates([
      "cache/beats.json",
      `${appDir}/cache/beats.json`,
      "render/beats.json",
      `${appDir}/render/beats.json`,
    ])) || {};
  return beats;
}


Now you won’t see “Command … not found” anymore because we’re not using invoke for these.

Where this integrates in your file (evidence): your current implementation calls invoke('read_cutlist') inside loadTimelineCuts() and logs a success even with zero items (because it caught the error and kept going) . Also your preview/export assume render/fapptap_proxy.mp4 / render/fapptap_final.mp4, so checking render/cutlist.json first is consistent with your paths .

Option B (also fine): actually add those Tauri commands

If you prefer the invoke('read_cutlist') API, add tiny readers in src-tauri/src/main.rs:

#[tauri::command]
async fn read_cutlist() -> Result<String, String> {
    use std::fs;
    for p in ["render/cutlist.json", "cache/cutlist.json"] {
        if let Ok(s) = fs::read_to_string(p) {
            return Ok(s);
        }
    }
    Err("cutlist.json not found in render/ or cache/".into())
}

#[tauri::command]
async fn read_beats_file() -> Result<String, String> {
    use std::fs;
    for p in ["cache/beats.json", "render/beats.json"] {
        if let Ok(s) = fs::read_to_string(p) {
            return Ok(s);
        }
    }
    Err("beats.json not found in cache/ or render/".into())
}


Register them:

fn main() {
  tauri::Builder::default()
    .plugin(tauri_plugin_shell::init())
    .plugin(tauri_plugin_fs::init())
    .plugin(tauri_plugin_dialog::init())
    .invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![
      read_cutlist,
      read_beats_file,
      // …any others you expose
    ])
    .run(tauri::generate_context!())
    .expect("error while running tauri application");
}


Your Cargo.toml and tauri.conf.json already have the right deps/plugins and permissive FS settings (asset protocol scope + fs plugin), so this will build cleanly .

Why this happened

StaticUnifiedApp.tsx expects backend commands read_cutlist and read_beats_file (nowhere implemented), so Tauri returns “Command … not found.” That’s consistent with the code paths around your loader and preview/export wiring .

Quick sanity checklist after the patch

Generate Preview:

Confirms render/cutlist.json (or cache/cutlist.json) exists post-stage.

The UI should log “✅ … loaded into editor” with a non-zero count.

Timeline is editable:

The list you render at the bottom should now reflect editor.timeline instead of a local timelineCuts array (your current file keeps a separate local state; switch it to use useEditor() so you’re actually editing) .

Export:

Before render, serialize editor.timeline back to render/cutlist.json so the backend renders the edited cutlist (not the original). If you still call worker.runStage("cutlist", …) in Export, that overwrites edits — remove that and just write the edited JSON.
