### Issue #1

Under 10 sec clips skipped
CHATGPT CONTEXT

Your builder creates events with global song times (in/out = beat times).

In the ffmpeg runner you do:
[{vi}:v] trim=start=<in>:end=<out> ...

For a short clip (e.g., 7s long), any event whose start is after ~7s produces no frames, so that clip appears to be “skipped.” It’s not a 10s hard-rule; it’s “anything shorter than the beat timestamp I asked for.”

What to change (conceptually)

Stop using song timeline for per-clip trims. Create per-clip local times:

Keep event length = seg = beat_times[i+1] - beat_times[i].

For each source clip, maintain a cursor (cursor[src]), starting at 0.0.

Set:

local_in = cursor[src]

local_out = local_in + seg

If local_out would pass the clip’s duration, either wrap (modulo) or reset cursor to 0 and try again.

Advance cursor[src] = local_out; if near the end, wrap to 0.

Optionally still snap local_in/out to that clip’s own shot edges.

Drop-in patch for build_cutlist.py (minimal, no DB required)

Paste this inside your main(...), replacing your current loop that builds events. It assumes you already have:

videos (list of absolute paths)

shots_map (dict: clip path → list of shots {start,end})

beat_times (after your auto-stride)

MIN_DUR, SNAP_TOL

import subprocess, json
from collections import defaultdict

def get_duration_ffprobe(path): # Fast one-liner to get duration; you can swap to SQLite if you prefer
try:
out = subprocess.check_output([
"ffprobe","-v","error","-show_entries","format=duration",
"-of","json", path
], text=True)
dur = float(json.loads(out)["format"]["duration"])
return max(0.0, dur)
except Exception:
return 0.0

# Precompute durations for each clip

durations = {src: get_duration_ffprobe(src) for src in videos}

# Cursor per clip (seconds, local to clip)

cursor = defaultdict(float)

events = []
vid_i = 0
for i in range(len(beat_times) - 1):
seg = beat_times[i+1] - beat_times[i]
if seg < MIN_DUR:
continue

    src = videos[vid_i % len(videos)]
    vid_i += 1
    dur = durations.get(src, 0.0)
    if dur <= 0.0:
        continue  # skip bad probe

    # Get local window for this clip
    start = cursor[src]
    end = start + seg

    # Wrap/reset if we run off the tail
    if end > dur:
        # Option A: wrap around
        # overshoot = end - dur
        # start = 0.0
        # end = min(overshoot, dur)

        # Option B (simpler): reset to 0 and take segment from head
        start = 0.0
        end = min(seg, dur)

    # Enforce min duration
    if end - start < MIN_DUR:
        # try starting at 0 if we were near the tail
        start = 0.0
        end = min(seg, dur)
        if end - start < MIN_DUR:
            continue  # clip too short for this segment size

    # Optional: snap to that clip's shot edges
    shots = shots_map.get(src, [])
    def snap_edge(t):
        if not shots: return t
        best = t; best_d = SNAP_TOL + 1
        for sh in shots:
            for edge in (sh["start"], sh["end"]):
                d = abs(t - edge)
                if d < best_d:
                    best_d, best = d, edge
        return best if best_d <= SNAP_TOL else t

    s_snap = snap_edge(start)
    e_snap = snap_edge(end)
    if e_snap - s_snap < MIN_DUR:
        # if snapping made it too short, fall back to unsnapped
        s_snap, e_snap = start, end

    events.append({
        "src": src,
        "in": round(s_snap, 3),     # LOCAL time within this clip
        "out": round(e_snap, 3),    # LOCAL time within this clip
        "effects": []
    })

    # Advance cursor; wrap to 0 if we are near the end
    cursor[src] = e_snap
    if dur - cursor[src] < MIN_DUR:
        cursor[src] = 0.0

Your event schema (in/out) now represents local clip time, which matches what the ffmpeg trim expects.

(Optional) Use your SQLite clips table for durations

Replace the get_duration_ffprobe block with:

import sqlite3
con = sqlite3.connect("cache/analysis.db")
rows = con.execute("SELECT path, duration FROM clips").fetchall()
db_durations = {str(Path(p).resolve()).replace('\\','/'): float(d) for p,d in rows}
durations = {src: db_durations.get(src, 0.0) for src in videos}

Why this fixes the “<10s clips are skipped”

Because now you never ask ffmpeg to trim at t=50s on a 7s clip. You always cut within that clip’s own timeline (0..7s), advancing a cursor and wrapping as needed. Short clips will still contribute—just in small repeating chunks—until the song ends.
