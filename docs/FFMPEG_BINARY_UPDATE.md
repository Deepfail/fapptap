# FFmpeg Binary Update - COMPLETED

## Issue Fixed

The ffmpeg and ffprobe sidecar binaries were stub .NET programs that only provided mock responses instead of actual FFmpeg functionality.

## Actions Taken

1. **Downloaded real FFmpeg binaries** from https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/download/latest/ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl.zip
2. **Replaced stub binaries** with actual FFmpeg executables:
   - `ffmpegbin-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe` - Real FFmpeg N-120864-g9a34ddc345-20250901
   - `ffprobebin-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe` - Real FFprobe N-120864-g9a34ddc345-20250901
3. **Forced clean Tauri rebuild** with `cargo clean` to ensure new binaries are picked up
4. **Verified functionality** - Both binaries tested and working in terminal

## Files Modified

- `src-tauri/binaries/ffmpegbin-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe` - Replaced with real FFmpeg binary (~171MB)
- `src-tauri/binaries/ffprobebin-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe` - Replaced with real FFprobe binary (~171MB)

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ FFmpeg binary working correctly (verified in terminal)
- ✅ FFprobe binary working correctly (verified in terminal)
- ✅ Sidecar configuration matching binary names
- ✅ Tauri v2 capabilities configured for real binaries
- ✅ Tauri app rebuilt and running successfully
- ✅ System Check Panel should now detect FFmpeg/FFprobe correctly
- ✅ Video processing functionality should now work

## Notes

- The real binaries are large (~171MB each) and may be excluded from git due to size limits
- This resolves the issue where System Check Panel would show Python worker errors instead of FFmpeg/FFprobe version info
- Video processing functionality should now work correctly in the desktop app
