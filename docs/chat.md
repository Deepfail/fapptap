# FAPPTap Development Chat Log

## Session: September 3, 2025

### Recent Progress

- ✅ Successfully merged PR #9: "Implement Tauri v2 Compliance and Performance-Optimized Video Timeline Editor"
- ✅ Fixed Rust compilation errors (job_id move issue)
- ✅ Cleaned up unused imports and variables
- ✅ Tauri app building and running successfully
- ✅ All new backend modules integrated (media_cache, file_scanner, thumbnail_generator, job_queue)
- ✅ Frontend timeline components and effects system in place

### Fixed: TypeScript Import Errors

**Problem:** VS Code was showing tons of compilation errors due to incorrect import paths
**Root Cause:** New timeline components were using relative imports instead of the project's `@/*` path aliases
**Solution Applied:**

- ✅ Fixed all import paths to use `@/` aliases (e.g., `@/state/playerStore` instead of `../../state/playerStore`)
- ✅ Removed unused imports and parameters
- ✅ Fixed missing UI component imports
- ✅ All major compilation errors resolved - only minor unused variable warnings remain

### Fixed: App Freezes When Selecting Audio Track

**Problem:** App freezes immediately when selecting an audio track
**Root Cause:** Audio selection was likely triggering automatic beat analysis processing
**Solution Applied:**

- ✅ Removed any automatic beat analysis triggers when audio is selected
- ✅ Added manual "Analyze Beats" button that user can click when ready
- ✅ Audio files now load safely without triggering expensive processing
- ✅ User has control over when to start beat analysis to prevent freezing

### Current Issue: App Crashes/Freezes During Scrolling

**Problem:** App crashes or freezes when scrolling in the timeline
**Root Causes Identified:**

1. Canvas re-rendering on every state change (expensive operations)
2. No throttling on scroll events - causing excessive re-renders
3. Complex mouse handling logic that may cause infinite loops

**Fixes Applied:**

- ✅ Added requestAnimationFrame to canvas rendering for smoother updates
- ✅ Added throttling to scroll handler (16ms / ~60fps)
- ✅ Removed unused dependencies from canvas useEffect
- ✅ Optimized drawing functions to only render visible elements

### Current Status

- Tauri dev server running with performance optimizations
- Ready for testing scroll performance
- App should be more stable during timeline interactions

### Next Steps

- Test the new performance improvements
- Monitor for any remaining crashes during scrolling
- Consider further optimizations if needed (e.g., virtualization, debouncing)
