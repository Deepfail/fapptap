### Project repositories

Main Tauri repositories you can contribute to are:

- The [core Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/) repository containing the Tauri runtime, build tools, macros and utils.
- [Plugins workspace](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace) repository with all the official Tauri plugins

Each of those Tauri repositories contains a `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` file. In it you will find instructions on how to set up local development environment and submit a Pull Request.
