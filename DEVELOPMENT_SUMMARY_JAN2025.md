```

### ðŸ”§ Technical Breakthrough Fixes

#### Tauri v2 Compliance

- **Asset Protocol**: Added `"enable": true` and proper scope for media file access
- **Sidecar Configuration**: Exact binary naming with platform suffixes (ffmpegbin-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe)
- **Permission Identifiers**: Core permissions use "core:" prefix, plugins use direct identifiers
- **Dynamic Imports**: Proper plugin loading with try/catch for missing plugins
- **withGlobalTauri**: Enabled for reliable runtime detection

#### Media Processing Pipeline

- **File Path Normalization**: Windows path handling with proper backslash to forward slash conversion
- **URL Generation**: Async convertFileSrc with fallback to file:// protocol for browser mode
- **Video Element Management**: Proper src resolution, error handling, and cleanup
- **Thumbnail Caching**: Efficient generation and storage of video thumbnails
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates for long-running video processing operations

#### Error Handling and Diagnostics

- **Comprehensive Logging**: File paths, converted URLs, binary versions, and operation status
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback behaviors when Tauri APIs are unavailable
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and progress indicators throughout the UI
- **System Validation**: Startup checks for binary availability and permissions

### ðŸ“Š Performance Optimizations

#### Resource Management

- **Memory Efficiency**: Proper disposal of video elements and media streams
- **Queue Processing**: Sequential operation processing to avoid resource conflicts
- **Lazy Loading**: Video metadata and thumbnails loaded on demand
- **Caching Strategy**: Thumbnail and analysis result caching to avoid regeneration

#### User Experience

- **Responsive UI**: Immediate feedback for all user actions
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Basic mode hides complexity, Advanced mode provides full control
- **Visual Indicators**: Play state, progress, and error status clearly displayed
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Space bar for play/pause, arrow keys for navigation
