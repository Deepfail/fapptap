## ðŸŽ¯ **CURRENT STATUS**

âœ… **MAJOR PROGRESS COMPLETED:**

- Render system completely rewritten and working with real cutlist data
- Virtual environment issues resolved
- Preset support added (landscape/portrait/square with crop-to-fill)
- Batching system implemented to handle large cutlists (356+ events)
- SAR normalization fixing video compatibility issues
- End-to-end video creation working with proxy quality

## ðŸš€ **PHASE 1: CORE FEATURES (CRITICAL)**

### 1. **Implement Beat-Driven Cutting Rate Modes**

**Priority: HIGHEST - This is the killer feature that differentiates the app**

#### **Backend Implementation:**

- [ ] **Modify `analysis/build_cutlist.py`** to accept cutting mode parameter

  - Add `--cutting-mode` argument: `slow`, `medium`, `fast`, `ultra-fast`, `random`, `auto`
  - Replace fixed `MIN_DUR = 0.40` with dynamic calculation based on mode + BPM
  - Implement tempo-aware cutting logic for each mode

- [ ] **Implement cutting mode algorithms:**

  ```python
  # In analysis/build_cutlist.py
  def get_cut_duration(mode, bpm, beat_strength=None):
      beat_interval = 60 / bpm
      if mode == "slow": return beat_interval * random.uniform(4, 8)
      elif mode == "medium": return beat_interval * random.uniform(2, 4)
      elif mode == "fast": return beat_interval * random.uniform(1, 2)
      elif mode == "ultra_fast": return beat_interval * random.uniform(0.5, 1)
      elif mode == "random": return beat_interval * random.choice([1,1,2,2,2,4,4,8])
      elif mode == "auto": return auto_analyze_section(beat_strength, bpm)
  ```

- [ ] **Add Random Mode with Intelligence:**

  - Weighted randomness (bias toward 2-4 beats)
  - Pattern avoidance (prevent consecutive same durations)
  - Seed control for reproducible results
  - Beat strength consideration for smart randomness

- [ ] **Update worker/main.py cutlist stage:**
  - Add `--cutting-mode` argument to argument parser
  - Pass cutting mode to build_cutlist function

#### **Backend Implementation:**

- [ ] **Enhance worker/main.py render stage:**
  - Add `--quality` argument: `proxy`, `final`
  - Implement different encoding settings:
    ```python
    if quality == "proxy":
        cmd_args.extend(["-c:v", "h264", "-crf", "28", "-preset", "ultrafast"])
    elif quality == "final":
        cmd_args.extend(["-c:v", "h264", "-crf", "18", "-preset", "slow"])
        cmd_args.extend(["-movflags", "+faststart"])  # Web optimization
    ```
  - Update output filenames: `{preset}_proxy.mp4` vs `{preset}_final.mp4`
  - Add progress tracking for longer final renders

#### **Frontend Integration:**

- [ ] **Add "Create Final Video" button to ActionsPane.tsx:**

  - Separate button from proxy render

This plan transforms FappTap from a working prototype into a production-ready, musically intelligent video editor with unique cutting rate capabilities that set it apart from all other video editing tools.

### 10. **BEAT-DRIVEN CUTTING RATES (CORE FEATURE)**

- [ ] **Priority: CRITICAL** - This is fundamental to the app's unique value
- [ ] **Issue**: Current system uses fixed 0.40s minimum with calculated stride
- [ ] **Problem**: All videos cut at same rate regardless of music character
- [ ] **Solution**: Implement tempo-aware cutting rate system with multiple modes

#### **Cutting Rate Presets:**

- [ ] **Slow Mode**: 4-8 beats per cut (0.8-3.2s @ 120 BPM)
- [ ] **Medium Mode**: 2-4 beats per cut (0.4-1.6s @ 120 BPM)
- [ ] **Fast Mode**: 1-2 beats per cut (0.2-0.8s @ 120 BPM)
- [ ] **Ultra Fast Mode**: Every beat/sub-beat (0.1-0.5s @ 120 BPM)
- [ ] **Random Mode**: Randomly rotate through different speeds/lengths for dynamic unpredictability

#### **Random Mode Implementation:**

- [ ] **Random Duration Selection**: Randomly choose between 1-8 beat durations
- [ ] **Weighted Randomness**: Bias toward musically appropriate lengths (2-4 beats more common)
- [ ] **Pattern Avoidance**: Prevent too many consecutive same-length cuts
- [ ] **Seed Control**: Optional seed parameter for reproducible randomness
- [ ] **Smart Randomness**: Consider beat strength when choosing random durations

#### **AUTO/AI Mode Features:**

- [ ] Analyze song sections (verse/chorus/bridge/drop)
- [ ] Adjust cutting rate based on energy/tempo changes
- [ ] Sync to downbeats vs regular beats vs subdivisions
- [ ] Consider beat strength data from advanced beat detection
- [ ] Implement energy-based cutting (faster during high energy)

#### **Technical Implementation:**

- [ ] Modify `analysis/build_cutlist.py` to accept cutting mode parameter
- [ ] Add `--cutting-mode` argument to worker/main.py cutlist stage
- [ ] Replace fixed `MIN_DUR` with dynamic calculation based on mode + BPM
- [ ] Implement random duration generator with configurable parameters
- [ ] Add UI controls for cutting mode selection
- [ ] Integrate with advanced beat detection for energy analysis
- [ ] Add preview of cutting pattern before generating cutlist

#### **Example Cutting Mode Calculations:**

```python
BPM = 128 (electronic music)
Beat interval = 60/128 = 0.469s

Slow: 4-8 beats = 1.875-3.75s per cut
Medium: 2-4 beats = 0.938-1.875s per cut
Fast: 1-2 beats = 0.469-0.938s per cut
Ultra Fast: 0.5-1 beat = 0.234-0.469s per cut
Random: 1-8 beats = 0.469-3.75s per cut (randomly chosen)
```

#### **UI Integration:**

- [ ] Add dropdown/radio buttons for cutting mode selection
- [ ] Show preview of expected cut rate based on detected BPM
- [ ] Display cutting mode in cutlist generation progress
- [ ] Add cutting mode to render output metadata

Todo to add:
FILE BROWSER

- File broswer performance: If a dir has a lot of videos, it crashes the app as it appears to try to load them all at once. Can we implement something here like lazyload or something similar to stop the app from crashing.
- When a folder has a lot of videos, it stretches the ui tries to accomidate so user has to scroll the entire length of the videos to see things that should always be seen like create videos. Perhaps there should be a always visible top and bottom bar? with the most vital settings
- We can get rid of the optional inline option and always play the videos in the browser inline it looks great.
- Replace the checkmark box when selecting it with a outline and/or gradiant over the image showing that it has been selected. You can barely see the checkbocx, and it feels natural just pressing it once to play it, and then leaving it on if you want it included.
- Add a SELECT ALL button at the top of the video browser.
- the Videos and load music should be "Add Videos" and "Add Music". They should be side by side not stacked.
- All portrait videos with slightly different dimensions should be cropped to the same size. Same rule for landscape and square. This makes it easy to tell what proportion video you are selecting. Also when square or landscape, should be centered vertically instead of at top.
- Filenames really arent very important in this setting. Lets try making them as a overlay on top of the videos, small font.
- Lets try adding a small thumbs button in addition to the view we have now to make it easier to see all or at least more of the videos in a file.
- Once videos are selected they should be placed onto the timeline in random order.
- Once selected, the browser view should close and be replaced with a vertical list of the selected videos which represent the order they are in. User should be able to drag and drop to change their order, or press a random button to randomize their order. The preview pane should show a preview of the videos in the order they are set as in the left sidebar. This sets up the ui to add video effects and tweak with the beat/cut settings and see a preview in real time before rendering the full video.

VIDEO PREVIEW

- Video preview is basically non-existent. I need to see a large video player with the beats/cuts displayed under it. This will allow user to see if beats/cuts are being placed in the correct spots, aka when there is a beat. If possible, for larger/stronger beats, a bigger dot or different color dot (such as downbeat being a different color then regular beats). It would also be great if I could create my own cuts on the timeline by clicking and creating a new one, or dragging an existing one.

EFFECTS

- Effects need to be added to the cuts. Each effect should have Low/Med/High, which will determine how much of that effect get added to the video. The placement of each effect should be randomized throughout all the cuts, and visually represented on the timeline with a colored dot. Preliminary effects we can add are Flash, RGB Glitch, Zoom, and Shake.
