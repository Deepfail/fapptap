# AUTO chat mode

This file documents the repository's AUTO chat mode for human readers. It intentionally contains no YAML frontmatter or embedded machine-readable blocks to avoid linter/schema complaints from Copilot or the editor.

How to trigger AUTO behavior (human instructions):

- When sending messages to an agent, include the line `mode: agent` at the top to request a non-interactive, CI-style run.
- Expected agent behavior when requested in AUTO mode:
  - Assume CI=true (no interactive prompts, no watch modes).
  - Attempt up to 3 automated fixes for transient failures.
  - Produce a single final summary with: what shipped, how to run (â‰¤3 commands), artifacts, assumptions, and follow-ups.
  - Avoid destructive operations (no credential/secret use without explicit consent).
